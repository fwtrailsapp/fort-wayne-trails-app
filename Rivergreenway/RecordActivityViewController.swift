/**
 
 RecordActivityViewController controls the Record Activity View, which is the
 view in which users record their activities on the trails using GPS. To enable
 the recording, this class communicates with a TrailActivityRecorder object
 
 The view enables users to control their recording through transitions between recording
 states: Created, Started, Paused, Resumed, and Finished (see: TrailActivityState.swift).
 While users record their activities, and the state of their recording is either 'Started'
 or 'Resumed', they can view live updates for the duration of their activity, the distance
 they have traveled, their current speed, and calories burned. Regardless of the recording
 state, they will also receive live location updates provided by GPS data and displayed
 on a Google Maps GMSMapView object.
 
 In addition to live location, speed, distance, duration, and calories burned updates, the
 view will also overlay a map of the Fort Wayne Regional Trail Network trails as well as an
 overlay of the user's path for the current activity. If the user pauses the recording, the
 live updates will pause as well - including the user's path updates. If a user moves while
 their recording is paused, there will be gaps in their path overlay on the map.
 
 When a user decides to finish recording their activity, they are presented with two options
 for the fate of their activity: Discard or Save. If they discard the activity, all of the
 activity data will be lost. If the user opts to save the activity, its data will be sent
 to the central server using the REST API. In any event, whether the activity is saved or
 discarded, the view is updated: the user's path on the GMSMapView Object is erased, as is
 the display of their activity duration, distance, speed, and calories burned.
