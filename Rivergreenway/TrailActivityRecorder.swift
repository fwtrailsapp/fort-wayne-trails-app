 This beast[sic] of a class maintains the state of an activity as it is being recorded. For
 persisting a completed activity, use this class's getActivity() method to return a TrailActivity
 object.
 
 The recorder has a TrailActivityState field, which follows a well-defined control flow:
 
                           Stopped
                             ^
                             |
     Created -> Started -> Paused -> Resumed
                             ^         |
                             |         |
                             +---------+
 
 Each of the transitions in the control flow has its own method (e.g. start()).
 
 The motivation for creating this class is simple. There is a significant amount of functionality
 required to maintain activity information while a user records that activity: behaviors for
 controlling the state of the activity (e.g. pausing), incrementing values, etc. This functionality
 doesn't really fit well in the RecordActivityViewController: view controllers are meant to control
 views, as their name suggests, and their functionality should be limited to that role as much as
 possible. It also does not fit well in the TrailActivity class either: that class is meant as a
 model of trail activities: it is meant to store data in such a way the same class can easily be
 used to send data to and from the server and to be represented visually in views. TrailActivity seems
 to make more sense as an immutable object rather than as an object that is meant to be continuously
 updated. With those two points in mind, the TrailActivityRecorder class was born.
